    "- Based on our overall analysis and supporting data, there is no material difference regarding age groups and winning.  Years of experience requires additional analysis.\n",
    "- There should be a heightened focus on recruiting European players.  Their hockey programs have significantly evolved, and the number of European players playing in the NHL is showing a steady increase, while the Canadian player representation is reducing.\n",
    "- More PPG equates to a higher overall point value and not a substitute for regular goals.\n",
    "- It is favorable and improves the likelihood of winning to have more consistency amongst contributing players vs having one or two superstars on the team.  The box plot comparing the +/- statistic supports this theor as the winning team has less outliers and more consistency when comparing the winning and losing team.  The +/- statistic is also the only key statistic analyzed that has a material difference(100% increase) in results when comparing the winning and losing team.\n",
    "- Future analysis reviewing Stanley Cup Finals' data only, can provide greater variability in data points and provide additional trending, influencing additional recommendations."
